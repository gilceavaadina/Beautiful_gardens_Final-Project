## Introduction

The website created is going to be a commercial website or service promotion. 
It is about to attract you from the point of view of structure, styling and dynamism to turn to this company that provides services. You decide if the site is trustworthy, navigation is easy and you even consider that this site deserves 10 stars. It is a basic website, but it is a great example of how HTML and CSS can be used to create a website that is both informative and visually appealing.More than this, JS comes to show you how easy you can interract with this App and how dynamism attracts you to stay on the site.

## Technologies Used

I used the following technologies to create this project:

- HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. It provides a structured way to define the content and structure of a webpage by using various HTML tags.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to define the presentation and appearance of HTML documents. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of your web pages.
- JS (JavaScript) is a high-level programming language commonly used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is a versatile language that runs on the client side (in the browser) as well as on the server side (with the help of Node.js).

## How to Run

To run the website created, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/gilceavaadina/Project_FASTTRACKIT.git


2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
